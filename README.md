# Conference Paper Review System

Required Node.js to be installed on machine.

## In VSCode:

1. Open the terminal in VS Code.
2. Connect to the backend folder and run "npm install"
3. Connect to the frontend foler and run "npm install"

Project uses XAMPP control panel for database managment

## Starting the program:

1. Connect to backend folder and run "npm start"
2. Connect to the frontend folder and run "npm start"

I will be working on a way to use the program as a 'guest' that doesn't need to interact with the database.
